Computer vision, a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI), involves enabling machines to interpret and understand visual information from the world. While the advancements in this technology hold immense potential across various sectors, they also raise significant ethical concerns. One of the primary issues is privacy. With the proliferation of surveillance cameras and facial recognition systems, individualsâ€™ movements and behaviors can be monitored without their consent, leading to potential violations of personal privacy.

Another ethical consideration is bias in computer vision algorithms. Many algorithms are trained on datasets that may not represent the diversity of the real world, which can result in biased outcomes that disproportionately affect marginalized communities. For instance, facial recognition technology has been shown to have higher error rates for people of color, raising questions about fairness and accountability.
